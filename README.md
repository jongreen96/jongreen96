# Welcome to My GitHub Profile!

I am a 26 year old developer who is currently learning to become a full stack web developer through Codecademy's full stack engineer course. My passion lies in website design, graphics, and the logic that controls it all. With the knowledge I have gained, I have already built a Reddit clone called "Recappit", and currently working on an e-commerce platform's backend using Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL. My goal is to continue honing my skills and use them to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites that are both functional and intuitive.

## My Skills

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript
-   React
-   Node.js
-   Git
-   Adobe Illustrator

## My Projects

-   **Recappit** - A Reddit clone that I built to practice my skills with web development. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js to create the front-end and Git for version control and collaboration. This project allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of building a web application from scratch and utilizing React.js to manage the state and interact with the API. I also got to practice my skills in responsive design, CSS animations, and overall website design to make it visually appealing.

-   **E-commerce API** - A project I am currently working on where I am building the backend using Node.js for an e-commerce platform. This API will be integrated with a separate front-end project, which will be used to sell digital products online. This project is pushing me to expand my skillset by delving into technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, sessions management, user authentication using Passport and PostgreSQL as database management system.

## My Vision

I am excited to share my projects and contributions with the world and I am always looking for new and interesting projects to work on. I believe that a great website should not only be functional, but also visually appealing and user-friendly. I am open to collaborate with other developers and learn from them. My expertise in Adobe Illustrator also allows me to create visually appealing designs for my projects.

Thank you for visiting my profile and I hope you enjoy my projects!
